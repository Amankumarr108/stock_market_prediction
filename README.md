# Stock Market Prediction Project

**Stock:** Apple (AAPL)  
**Data Period:** 2018-2023  
**Prediction:** Next 30 Days Closing Price  

## About the Project
This project predicts Apple stock prices using historical data.  
It uses an **LSTM model** to learn trends from past stock prices and forecast the next 30 days.

### What I Did:
- Downloaded historical stock data using Python's **yfinance**.
- Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.
- Visualized past stock trends using **Matplotlib**.
- Built and trained an **LSTM neural network** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Predicted stock prices for the next 30 days.
- Created an interactive chart using **Plotly**.
- Saved predictions in a **CSV file**.

## How to Run
1. Open `stock_market_prediction.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. See the interactive chart and predicted prices.
4. Check `future_30_days_prediction.csv` for predicted values.
